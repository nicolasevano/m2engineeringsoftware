        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
      
			
        Cut cube steak into serving size pieces. Coat meat with the bread crumbs
        and parmesan cheese. Heat olive oil in a large frying pan, and saute 1
        teaspoon of the garlic for 3 minutes. Quick fry (brown quickly on both sides)
        meat. Place meat in a casserole baking dish, slightly overlapping edges.
        Place onion rings and peppers on top of meat, and pour marinara sauce
        over all.
      
			
        Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 45 minutes, depending on
        the thickness of the meat. Sprinkle mozzarella over meat and leave in the
        oven till bubbly.
      
			
        Boil pasta al dente. Drain, and toss in butter and 1 teaspoon garlic. For a
        stronger garlic taste, season with garlic powder. Top with grated parmesan
        and parsley for color. Serve meat and sauce atop a mound of pasta!

<td>
      Make the meat ahead of time, and refrigerate over night, the acid in the
      tomato sauce will tenderize the meat even more. If you do this, save the
      mozzarella till the last minute.

        Cut the stack of phyllo sheets in half and lay between two damp, clean 
        towels. Lightly dust with flour and roll each of the 18 pieces of dough 
        to a diameter of 6 to 8 inches. Set aside.Place about 1/2 cup of the chicken 
        mixture into a half sheet of phyllo and wrap like an egg roll into a neat, 
        tight package. Place the phyllo-wrapped chicken on the rolled dough, and brush 
        the egg white around it.
      
			
        Fold the bottom of the dough up onto the phyllo to form the foot of the 
        coffin. Then fold up the sides and top of the dough, pinching it together 
        to make a cross shape on the top. Repeat for each sarcophage. Cover and
        chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
      
			
        Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Brush the pastry with egg white and bake 
        for 15 minutes, or till golden brown. 18 servings.

<td>Ricotta Pie</td>
<td/>
<td>
			
        Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease two deep dish pie
        plates.
      
			
        Roll out 2 of the balls to fit into the pie pans. Do not make the crust too thick
        as it will expand during cooking and get too thick. Do not flute the edges of
        the dough. Roll out the other 2 balls of dough and cut each into 8 narrow
        strips for the top of the crust. Alternately you can use cookie cutters and
        place the cutouts on the top of the pies.
      
			
        Pour the filling evenly into the pie crusts. Top each pie with 8 narrow strips
        of dough or cookie cut-outs. Brush top of pie with milk for shine. Place foil on
        the edge of crust.
      
			
        Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 20 to 30 minutes then remove
        foil. Continue to bake for another 25 or 30 minutes or until a knife inserted in
        the center comes out clean.

        Warm up the milk in a nonstick sauce pan
      
			
        In a large bowl beat the egg yolks with the sugar, add the flour 
        and combine the ingredients until well mixed.
      
			
        Add the milk, a little bit at the time to the egg mixture, mixing well.
      
			
        Put the mixture into the sauce pan and cook it on the stove at a medium 
        low heat. Mix the cream continuously with a wooden spoon. When it starts
        to thicken remove it from the heat and pour it on a large plate to cool off.
      
			
        Stir the cream now and then so that the top doesn't harden.
      
			
        Dip quickly both sides of the lady fingers in the liquor. Layer them one 
        at the time in a glass bowl large enough to contain 7 biscuits.
      
			
        Spread 1/3 of the cream and repeat the layer with lady fingers. Finish 
        with the cream.

<td>
      Refrigerate for at least 4 hours better yet overnight. Before serving 
      decorate the zuppa inglese with whipped cream.
